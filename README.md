# 🚌 Advanced Bus Route Planner (PDSA-Focused Android Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Advanced Bus Route Planner** is an Android application designed using **Pure Data Structures and Algorithms (PDSA)** concepts.  
The system helps users find optimal bus routes in Sri Lanka based on **distance, time, cost, transfers, accessibility**, and other real-world constraints — **without using Machine Learning**.

This project demonstrates strong academic rigor in **graph representation, shortest path algorithms, optimization techniques**, and **Android integration**.
